# DalSocial
People lost touch with social connectivity during the COVID epidemic, which resulted in a lack of emotional support and face-to-face interaction. It became challenging to return to normal. Therefore, it's crucial to surround yourself with like-minded individuals during tough times. How can you locate individuals who share your interests and job goals? The simplest solution would be to look for that person using an app that allows you to do so whenever and wherever you desire. The primary purpose of the software is to let users connect with others, establish friendships, find support, expand their businesses, and pursue their interests.

Our app is suitable for all students trying to build a community by meeting up with like-minded people and interacting with them. We welcome students to explore different cultures, gain knowledge on different aspects of life, find their interests and much more. This application will allow the students to explore the nearby get-togethers we call a `MeetUp` and talk on a specific agenda. We welcome people of all interests, whether talking about the latest technologies or just having a drink and meeting new people.

This college assignment is built in Android using Kotlin, MUI for styling and Google Firebase as the backend of the application.
